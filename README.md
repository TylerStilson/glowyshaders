# glowyshaders

I created an fun app in unity, for Dixie State University. That apps functionality is to display a fun User Interface to tell the cashiers and registration lanes
if their lanes are open or not, and then give them the opportunity to open and close them.

I wrote many scripts to make the api calls to talk to the server and turn the lanes off and on, but they have university info i cant share. So here is the asset folder
containing the shaders i created in unity, and a moving stary background!
